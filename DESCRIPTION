Description: Provides tools to analyze vaccine coverage data and simulate potential disease outbreak scenarios. It allows users to calculate key epidemiological metrics such as the effective reproduction number (Re), outbreak probabilities, and expected infection counts based on county-level vaccination rates, disease characteristics, and vaccine effectiveness. The package includes historical kindergarten vaccination data for Florida counties and offers functions for generating summary tables, visualizations, and exporting the underlying plot data.
